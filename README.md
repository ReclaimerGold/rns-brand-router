## Installation

1. Download the plugin files to your WordPress plugins directory:
   ```
   /wp-content/plugins/rns-brand-router/
   ```

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

3. Ensure you have WooCommerce installed and active

4. Make sure your products have brand taxonomy (`product_brand`) assigned

## Usage

### Grid Display
Use the grid shortcode to display brands in a responsive grid layout:

```php
[rns_brand_router]
```

### Slider Display
Use the slider shortcode to display top brands in an animated carousel:

```php
[rns_brand_slider]
```

### URL Filtering
Both shortcodes support category filtering via URL parameters:

```
https://yoursite.com/brands/?brand_cat=electronics
```

This will show only brands that have products in the "electronics" category.

## Configuration

    width: 250px; /* Default: 200px */
}

/* Example: Change grid hover effects */
.rns-brand-box:hover {
    transform: translateY(-5px);
    transition: transform 0.3s ease;
}
```

## URL Routing
